		\item Let C be a chain complex with an action of the symmetric group, which induces an action of the cyclic group.
		Let W $\to$ C be a Cyc equivariant map. Do you know of an example for which there is no factoring of this map through ESym, a resolution of the symmetric group, such that W $\to$ ESym is a Cyc quasi-iso and ESym $\to$ C is Sym equivariant?
