		\item Instead of May structure I would suggest a term that uses $r$.
		Notice that the associativity plays no role though.
		Also, May does not require equality with the product, but simply the existence of a homotopy to it.

		\item I would use property not axiom. I made the changes throughout.

		\item We should try to find a better name instead $r$-cyclic assymmetry with duality.

		\item Use \verb|--| instead of \verb|-| for pairs of names like May--Steenrod.
