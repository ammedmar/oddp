		\item Instead of May structure I would suggest a term that uses $r$.
		Notice that the associativity plays no role though.
		Also, May does not require equality with the product, but simply the existence of a homotopy to it. \federico{The official name in Definition 4.2 is ($r$-cyclic) May structure, with $r$-cyclic an adjective to be dropped to lighten the reading. I have added $r$-cyclic in the introduction and added the homotopy to the definition}

		\item I would use property not axiom. I made the changes throughout. \federico{good}

		\item We should try to find a better name instead $r$-cyclic assymmetry with duality. \federico{agreed, any suggestion is welcome. This function chooses an element for each subset, so it is a "choice function" or "selection". If one defines an element of $A\subset \{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}$ to be a "first element of $A$" if its cyclic predecessor is not in $A$, then the condition "with duality" means that we are equivariantly selecting a first element of each subset. Does this suggest a name to you?}

		\item Use \verb|--| instead of \verb|-| for pairs of names like May--Steenrod. \federico{ok}
