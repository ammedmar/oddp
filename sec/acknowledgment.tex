\subsection*{Acknowledgment}

We thank Martin Palmer for noticing the simple description of cyclic assemblage maps with duality via cyclic choices of subsets of $\{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}$. We thank Geoffroy Horel for raising an objection to the existence of non-trivial stable comultiplications and for refuting it afterwards.
\anibal{I would just thank both of them for insightful comments and questions. But I don't feel strongly about it}
