\subsection{Compatibility with suspension}

There standard suspension functor in the category of pointed semi-simplicial sets sends a semi-simplicial set $X_\bullet$ to the semi-simplicial set $(\Sigma X)_\bullet$ defined as:
\begin{align*}
    (\Sigma X)_n &= X_{n-1},& d_i(\Sigma\sigma) &= \Sigma d_{i+1}(\sigma),& d_{0}(\Sigma \sigma) &= *.
\end{align*}
Another possible and less standard definition of the suspension is the following:
\begin{align*}
    (\hat{\Sigma} X)_n &= X_{n-1}, &d_i(\hat{\Sigma}\sigma) &= \hat{\Sigma} d_i(\sigma),& d_{n+1}(\hat{\Sigma} \sigma) &= *.
\end{align*}
Similarly, we have the standard suspension of a chain complex $(C_*,\partial)$:
\begin{align*}
    (\Sigma C)_n &= C_{n-1}, & \partial (\Sigma c) = -\Sigma \partial c.
\end{align*}
and the less standard suspension:
\begin{align*}
    (\hat{\Sigma} C)_n &= C_{n-1}, & \partial (\hat{\Sigma} c) = \hat{\Sigma} \partial c.
\end{align*}
We also have that, for a semi-simplicial set $X_\bullet$ \begin{align*}
    \chains(\Sigma X)&\cong \Sigma \chains(X) & \chains(\hat{\Sigma}X) &\cong \hat{\Sigma}\chains(X)
\end{align*}

Now, if $\mu_{k}\colon \colon N_*(X)\to N_*(X)^{\otimes r}$ is the symmetric comultiplication in degree $k$, then we can define
\begin{align*}
    \Sigma \mu_k\colon \Sigma N_*(X)&\lra \Sigma N_*(X)^{\otimes r}
    &
    \hat{\Sigma} \mu_k\colon \hat{\Sigma} N_*(X)&\lra \hat{\Sigma} N_*(X)^{\otimes r}
\end{align*}
which, under the above isomorphisms have the same domain and codomain as $\mu_{k+r-1}$.
\begin{proposition}
    \begin{align*}
        \Sigma \mu_k &= \rho(\mu_{k+r-1}) &
        \hat{\Sigma} \mu_k &= \mu_{k+r-1}
    \end{align*}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\tau$ be a generator of $N_m(X)$, so that \[\mu_k(\tau) = \mathrm{rev}\circ \alpha\circ\beta\circ\beta'\circ \Psi(e_{(r-1)m-k}^\vee\otimes \vec{\tau}).\]

    On the other hand, writing $\xi = \Sigma \tau$, we have
    \[\mu_{k+r-1}(\Sigma \tau) = \mathrm{rev}\circ \alpha\circ\beta\circ\beta'\circ \Psi(e_{(r-1)(m+1)-(k-r+1)}^\vee\otimes \vec{\xi})\]
     Observe now that $k+r-1-(r-1)(m+1) = k-(r-1)m$, and therefore the words that will appear in the formulas for $\Psi(e_{(r-1)m-k}\otimes \vec{\tau})$ and $\Psi(e_{(r-1)m-k}\otimes \vec{\xi})$ are the same, while the sequences $U$ that appear in the formulas for $\Psi(e_{(r-1)m-k}\otimes \vec{\tau})$ are bounded by $m$ and the ones appearing in $\Psi(e_{(r-1)m-k}\otimes \vec{\xi})$ are bounded by $m+1$.

     Write $q = (r-1)m-k$.
     \[\Psi(e_{q}\otimes \vec{\tau}) = \sum_{U\in C^{q}(\Delta^m)}\sum_{w\in C^q(EC_r)} (U,w)\otimes \vec{\tau} \]
     Hence
     \begin{align*}
         \Sigma\Psi(e_{q}\otimes \vec{\tau})
         &= \sum_{U\in C^{q}(\Delta^m)}\sum_{w\in C^q(EC_r)} (\Sigma U,\rho(w))\otimes \vec{\tau} \\
         &= \sum_{U\in C^{q}(\Delta^m)}\sum_{w\in C^q(EC_r)} (U,\rho(w))\otimes \vec{\tau} \\
         &= \Psi(\rho(e_q^\vee)\otimes \vec{\tau})
    \end{align*}
    In the first equality we had to take $\rho(w)$ (recall that this is a dual action, hence $\rho(a) = a-1$) to counteract the effect of $\Sigma$ on $U$, which reindexes the indices by one up. In the second equality we use that any $U$ containing a $0$ yields a trivial summand because in $\Sigma X$ the face map $d_0$ sends everything to the basepoint. This proves the first claim, and an analogous argument proves the second claim.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Stable $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ actions after [Gill20]}

Now, if $\mathbf{E}$ is a spectrum, we can define the spectral chains $C_*(\mathbf{E})$, taking the colimit
\[C_n(\mathbf{E}_0)\lra C_{n+1}(\mathbf{E}_1)\lra \ldots\]
The spectral chains come equipped with a stable $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ structure. The $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ operad has several models, as the stable Eilenberg-Zilber operad or the stable surjection operad, and are always defined as the limit of the suspension endomorphism of the unstable operad
\[\lim(\ldots \Sigma^2 \chi \lra \Sigma \chi\lra \chi).\]
Now, these models are clearly not finitely generated (nor free, nor of finite type), so even if the spectrum of which we are taking spectral chains is finite, the model of the action is not finite.

Also: the complexity in the definition of the operations grows as the dimension of the degree of the domain grows. Not only because bigger simplices have more overlapping intervals, but also because the surjections that appear as summands in $\mu_{k+1}$ are more involved (and different) from the surjections that appear in $\mu_k$.

By the proposition above (and its proof), we observe that our new formula for $\mu_k$ on an $m$-dimensional simplex is almost the same as the formula for $\mu_{k+r-1}$ on an $(m+1)$-dimensional simplex: both are indexed by the same words.

\subsection{Alexander product}

Recall that a semi-simplicial set $X$ can be viewed as an augmented semi-simplicial pointed set $X_+$ by taking augmening $X$ with the basepoint.

The operation induced in degree $0$
\[\mu_0\colon N_m(\Delta^n)\lra (N_*(\Delta^n)^{\otimes r})_m\]
is indexed by words of length $m(r-1)$, with the coefficient $\frac{1}{(\tilde{r}!)^m}$ and a CERTAIN SIGN TO BE COMPUTED. As observed before, $\tilde{r}!\mod r$ is one of the two square roots of $-1$. Moreover, since $\Delta^n$ is augmented with the basepoint, all summands of $\mu_0(\tau)$ that involve elements of degree $0$ are automatically zero in $\Delta^n$ (but not in $\Delta^n_+$). Say that those elements are \emph{suboptimal}. A word $(w_0,w_1,\ldots,w_q)$ in $EC_r$ is \emph{ascending} if $w_{i+1} = w_i+1\mod r$.

\begin{proposition}
    The non-suboptimal summands in $\mu_0(\tau)$ are those indexed by ascending words.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
    The non-suboptimal summands indexed by ascending words form the Alexander diagonal. The sign is as follows: BLABLA
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
    $\mu_0$ is the usual diagonal. [I highly doubt that we get the same signs]
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Augmentations} It is remarkable that these operations extend to the category of augmented (pointed) semi-simplicial sets, something that was not available through the surjection operad description.

\subsection{Power operations} A symmetric comultiplication induces power operations
\[P^k\colon H^*(\Delta^n)\to \Sigma^{-k} H^*(\Delta^n)\]
defined as $P^k(x) =\nu(m)\cdot \mu_{(r-1)m-k}^*(x\otimes x\otimes\ldots\otimes x)$. In our case the action of $C_r$ on $N(\Delta^n)^{\otimes r}$ factors through the action of the symmetric group $\Sigma_r$, and therefore only some of these operations survive.
