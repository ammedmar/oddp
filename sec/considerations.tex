\section{Other considerations}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item These operations are compatible with suspension.
	\item Cup product is the Alexander cup product (possibly divided by a scalar).
	\item Succint description of the higher power operations.
	\item A measurement of the computational complexity of these operations.
	\item Comparison with previous formulas.
	\item The case $r=2$. It is not trivial: $C^*(EC_2)\neq W^*(2)$.
\end{enumerate}
