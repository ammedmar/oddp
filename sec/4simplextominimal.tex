\section{Maps between resolutions of the cyclic group}\label{s:resolutions}

Except for the last part of this section, we assume that $r$ is odd. In the first part of this section we construct a homomorphism from $\chains_*(\asimplex^{r-1})$ to $\rW_*(r)$ when $r$ is odd. In the second and third parts we further assume that $r$ is prime and we extend this homomorphism to a homomorphism from the whole $\Omega_*(r)$ satisfying the conditions of Lemma \ref{lemma:omegar}. In Section \ref{ss:milnor} we explain how the above homomorphism yields a chain homomorphism from $\chains_*(\EC_r)$ to $W_*(r)$ when $r$ is odd, and in Section \ref{ss:even} we discuss the case $r=2$.

\subsection{From the simplex to the minimal resolution} 

Through the isomorphism $\Cyc_r \cong \{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}$ we endow the latter with a group structure. Given two numbers $a,b\in \{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}$, the cyclic difference $b-a$ is computed using this group structure. Given a sequence $(a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1})\in \{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}$, write $a_0\prec a_1\prec \ldots\prec a_{q-1}$ if there are integers $\bar{a}_1,\ldots,\bar{a}_{q-1}$ that differ from $a_1,\ldots,a_{q-1}$ by a multiple of $r$ such that $a_0<\bar{a}_1<\ldots<\bar{a}_{q-1}<a_0+r$. Define
\begin{align*}
    \phi_{e}(a,b) &= \begin{cases}
        \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{\frac{b-a}{2}} \rho^{a+2i} & \text{if $b-a$ is even} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise,}
    \end{cases}
    \\
    \phi_{o}(a,b) &= \begin{cases}
         \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{\frac{b-a-1}{2}} \rho^{a+2i+1} & \text{if $b-a$ is odd} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise,}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
and note that, if $a\prec b\prec c$, with $b-a$ even, then $\phi_o(a,c) = \phi_e(a,b) + \phi_o(b,c)$, while if $b-a$ is odd, then $\phi_o(a,c) = \phi_e(a,b) + \phi_o(b,c)$. We also have $\phi_e(a,c) = \phi_o(a,b+1)+\phi_o(b,c)$. 

Let $a_0\prec a_1\prec\ldots\prec a_{q-1}$ be a cyclically ordered sequence in $\{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}$. Say that $a_i$ is \emph{even (resp. \emph{odd}) in the sequence} if $a_{i+1}-a_i$ is an even number (resp. an odd number). 
Define the following elements of $\rW_*(r)$:
\begin{align*}
    \Phi_e(a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}) &= \begin{cases}
        (-1)^{j+1}\phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1})\cdot e_q & \text{if $A$ has a single even entry $a_j$} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \\
    \Phi_o(a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}) &= \begin{cases}
        \sum_{j=0}^{q-1} \phi_o(a_j,a_{j+1})\cdot e_q & \text{if $A$ has no even entries} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

A \emph{cyclic representative} of a generator $[a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}]\in \chains_q(\partial \asimplex^{r-1})$ is a cyclically ordered sequence $(a_{\sigma(0)},\ldots,a_{\sigma(q-1)})$. Removing an element from the sequence keeps the property of being cyclically ordered. The assignments $\Phi_e(A)$ and $\Phi_o(A)$ induce well defined assigments $\Phi_e[a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}]$ and $\Phi_o[a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}]$ on the generators of $\chains_*(\asimplex^{r-1})$. In what follows we work always with these cyclic representatives.
\begin{theorem} The linear homomorphism with $\bZ[\frac{1}{\tilde{r}}]$-coefficients
\begin{align*}
    \Phi\colon \chains_*(\partial \asimplex^{r-1})&\lra \rW_*(r) 
    &
    \Phi(A) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{(\tilde{r}-\tilde{q}-1)!}{\tilde{r}!}\Phi_e(A) & \text{if $q$ is even} \\
    \frac{(\tilde{r}-\tilde{q}-1)!}{\tilde{r}!}\Phi_o(A) & \text{if $q$ is odd} 
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
is a chain homomorphism.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
	If $r=3$, then $\bZ[\frac{1}{\tilde{r}!}] = \bZ$ and if $r$ is prime, then $\mathbb{F}_r$ is a $\bZ[\frac{1}{\tilde{r}!}]$-algebra, hence these coefficients are also allowed.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof} In order to simplify the notation, we will omit the generator $e_q$ in the formulas below. 
Suppose first that $A = [a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}]$ has even length, in which case $\tilde{r}-\tilde{q}-1 = \tilde{r}-\widetilde{q-1}-1$. If $A$ has more than one even entry, then all sequences in its boundary have at least two even entries, and therefore $\Phi_o(\partial A) = 0$. If $A$ has a single even entry $a_j$, then 
\begin{align*}
    \partial \Phi_e(A) &= (-1)^{j+1}\partial \phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1}) = (-1)^{j+1}\left(\rho\phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1}
    ) - \phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1})\right).
\end{align*}
On the other hand, since $[a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_i,\ldots,a_{q-1}]$ will have two even entries unless $i=j$ or $i=j+1$, we have that
\begin{align*}
    \Phi_o(\partial A) 
    &= (-1)^{j}\left(\Phi_o [a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_j,\ldots,a_{q-1}]-\Phi_o [a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_{j+1},\ldots,a_{q-1}]\right)
\end{align*}    
Now, using that $\phi_o(a_{j-1},a_{j+1}) = \phi_o(a_{j-1},a_j) + \phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1})$, the first summand equals
\[
\phi_o(a_j-1,a_j) + \phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1})+\sum_{i\neq j-1,j} \phi_o(a_i,a_{i+1}).
\]
Using that $\phi_o(a_{j},a_{j+2}) = \phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1})+\phi_o(a_{j+1},a_{j+2})$, the second summand equals
\[
\phi_e(a_j+1,a_{j+1}+1) + \phi_o(a_{j+1},a_{j+2})+\sum_{i\neq j,j+1} \phi_o(a_i,a_{i+1}).
\]
Therefore, most terms cancel and we are left with the value of $\partial \Phi_e[a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}]$.

Suppose now that $A$ has odd length, in which case $\tilde{r}-\tilde{q}-1 = \tilde{r}-\widetilde{q-1} $. If $A$ has more than two even entries, then $\Phi_e([a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_i,\ldots,a_{q-1}]) = 0$ for all $i$, therefore $\Phi_e(\partial A) = 0$. If $A$ has exactly two even entries $a_j,a_k$, then we have two cases: if these entries are not consecutive and $j<k$, then the nontrivial summands in $    \Phi_e(\partial A)$ are
\begin{align*}
 (-1)^j\Phi_e[a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_j,\ldots,a_{q-1}] &= (-1)^j(-1)^{k}\phi_e(a_k,a_{k+1}) \\
  (-1)^{j+1}\Phi_e[a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_{j+1},\ldots,a_{q-1}] &=  (-1)^{j+1}(-1)^{k}\phi_e(a_k,a_{k+1}) 
  \\
   (-1)^{k}\Phi_e[a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_k,\ldots,a_{q-1}] &= (-1)^k(-1)^{j+1}\phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1}) \\
    (-1)^{k+1}\Phi_e[a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_{k+1},\ldots,a_{q-1}] &= (-1)^{k+1}(-1)^{j+1}\phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1})
\end{align*}
which cancel in pairs. If the entries are consecutive, then $k=j+1$ and the nontrivial summands in $\Phi_e(\partial A)$ are
\begin{align*}
 (-1)^j\Phi_e[a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_j,\ldots,a_{q-1}] &=  (-1)^{j}(-1)^{j+1}\phi_e(a_{j+1},a_{j+2}) \\
  (-1)^{j+1}\Phi_e[a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_{j+1},\ldots,a_{q-1}] &= (-1)^{j+1}(-1)^{j+1}\phi_e(a_j,a_{j+2}) \\
   (-1)^{j+2}\Phi_e[a_0,\ldots,\hat{a}_{j+2},\ldots,a_{q-1}] &=  (-1)^{j+2}(-1)^{j+1}\phi_e(a_j,a_{j+1}) 
\end{align*}
and the middle summand cancels with the other two.

If $A$ has no even entry, then
\[
    \partial \Phi_o[a_0,\ldots,a_{q-1}] = N\left(\sum_{i=0}^{q-1} \phi_o(a_i,a_{i+1})\right) = \frac{r-q}{2}N(e_{q-1})
\]
On the other hand,
\[
    \Phi_e(\partial A)
    = \sum_{i=0}^{q-1} \phi_e(a_i,a_{i+2}) \\
    = \sum_{i=0}^{q-1} \phi_o(a_{i},a_{i+1}+1) + \phi_o(a_{i+1},a_{i+2}) \\
    = N(e_{q-1})
\]
This completes the proof, since $\frac{r-q}{2} = \tilde{r}-\tilde{q}-1$.
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}
	For each $0\leq q<r-1$, let $L_q\subset (\partial \asimplex^{r-1})_q$ be the set of those simplices $[a_0,\ldots, a_{q-1}]$ with increasing entries (in the total order) such that $a_{2i}$ is even and different from $r-1$, and $a_{2i+1}$ is odd. Then the linear dual of $\Phi$ has the following expression
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:111}
		\Phi^\vee(e_{q}) = \frac{(\tilde{r}-\tilde{q}-1)!}{\tilde{r}!}\sum_{A\in L_q} A^\vee.
	\end{equation}
