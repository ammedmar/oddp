\begin{abstract}
	We observe that the integral chains of a standard augmented simplex form a (differential graded) Poincar\'e duality algebra.
	Using the dual viewpoint this provides, we model May--Steenrod operations at the cochain level via cup-$(p,i)$ products having various desirable properties: stability, universality, ...

\begin{abstract}
    We define a structure on a chain complex that produces power operations in its cohomology with the property that the zero'th power is always the identity. We then use this structure to define cochain level operations for augmented simplicial objects and show that they behave nicely with suspension. These operations remain well-defined in the chain complex of a Kan spectrum. The main tool to build them is a duality on the integral chains of the standard augmented simplex.
