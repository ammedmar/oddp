% \begin{abstract}
%     We define a structure (``connected cyclic diagonal'') on a chain complex that produces stable power operations in its cohomology with the property that the negative power operations always vanish. This structure is designed to encode power operations for spectra, whose cohomology lacks a cup product. We then use this structure to define cochain level operations for augmented simplicial objects. The main tool to build them is a duality on the integral chains of the standard augmented simplex.

%    We introduce a structure termed ``connected cyclic diagonal" on a chain complex, which induces stable power operations in its cohomology with the property that negative power operations consistently vanish.
%%    This chain level structure is useful to represent power operations for spectra, whose cohomology lacks a cup product.
%%    Using a Poincar\'e duality algebra structure on the integral chains of the standard augmented simplex,
%We provide an effective method for the construction of connected cyclic diagonals on the chain complex of a broad class of augmented simplicial objects as well as Kan spectra.


\begin{abstract}
 	Using simplicial methods, we provide a new chain level construction of power operations on a large class of examples which include simplicial sets, augmented simplicial coalgebras, and Kan spectra.
	The method is broadly general yet produces operations that vanish explicitly in negative degrees.
% 	The resulting formulas generalize to odd primes those obtained by the seconed-named author for the even prime and share their computational advantages.
