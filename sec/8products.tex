\section{Products} \label{s:8products}
Let $X$ be a simplicial object in $\cC$, and suppose that the diagonal $\Delta$ is defined for $r=2$. The composition
\[
    N_*(X)\overset{\Delta}{\lra} N_*(X\times X) \overset{AW}{\lra} N_*(X)\otimes N_*(X)
\]
induces an associative comultiplication on the homology of $X$. Let $\mu$ be the connected comultiplication defined in Theorem \ref{thm2:mainthm}.
\begin{theorem}
    The homomorphism $\tau\mapsto \mu(e_{(r-1)(m-1)},\tau)$ is a chain map and equals the $r$-fold comultiplication of $\tau$ described above.
\end{theorem}
